1. Open Eclipse
2. Click on `File` > `Import` > `Git` > `Projects from Git` > `Clone URI`
3. In the `Clone URI` window, paste the following URL:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/xJQx/sc2002-fypms.git
   ```

4. Click `Next` and follow the prompts to finish the cloning process
5. Once the project is cloned, right-click on the project folder and select `Properties`
6. In the `Properties` window, click on `Java Build Path` > `Source` > `Add Folder`
7. Select the `src` folder from the project directory and click `OK`
8. Now you can run the project by right-clicking on `FypmsApp.java` in the `src/main` folder and selecting `Run As` > `Java Application`

That's it! You should now have the project up and running in Eclipse.
